                        <p>The trek to Nagaru is important as it has the most arduous Summit point. The trek lasts for 4
                            to 5 hours to attain a height of 13500 feet, the highest point in the region with the lowest
                            temperature. Start the trek from Min Thach to Nagaru passing through the jungle which takes
                            you to another ridge, from here a blooming meadow can be seen and at the top is the
                            campsite.The initial trek is well marked, continue trekking and you will see the receding
                            tree line. Some part of the trail gets because of heavy snow which makes the steep slope
                            slippery. After the hard climb reaches Nagaru.
                            This place offers the mesmerising sight of Chanderkhani, Min Thach, Grahan village, the town
                            of Manikaran, River Beas and Parvati valley. This is the place where the photographers spend
                            hours to shoot some scenic timelapse.

                        <p>After summiting the peak, the trek continues to descend at an altitude to about 10000 feet to
                            Biskeri Thach while crossing the Sarpass. The distance to Sar Pass is long so starting early
                            today, trekking on snow will make the climb challenging. But, the scenic views will not
                            leave your side.Start the trek towards Biskeri Thach, through a narrow valley. Cross streams
                            on the way and reach the campsite, from here grasslands, pine forests and high mountains are
                            visible.Cross a steep ascent to reach the top of the hill from where Tosh valley peaks and
                            snow-covered mountains are visible. Just 2 more hours of the hike will lead you to Sar Pass.
                            Again climb a ridge and from there you can see a Trishul with tied flags.
                            We will have a night hold at Biskeri Thach followed by delicious dinner. You can also have a
                            glance at these villages – Bursheni, Tosh, Nakthan, Pugla and Tugla.
